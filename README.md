# Additional
  * I know apprearence is part of the criteria. But I have just changed 2 things. 
     * 1. changed bottn color. Just because red botton seems warining sign to me. 
     * 2. Changed the text of the botton to "Click Here To Generate Password" so easier for user to know what they need to do. I thought.    

# What I learned from this homework
 * I have started this course without any background. So when I was using internet just as regular life, I was not thinking about how all those function is working behind the screen which I was seeing. This is defenitly not easy to understand, I still have so many questions and things I need to work to better understanding. But I am still enjoying what I am learning everyday and knowing how this web world has been created.
